            <h2>A brief summary of Schumacher's journey</h2>
            <h3>Early life</h3>
            <b>
                Michael Schumacher was born in the West German town of Hürth, North Rhine-Westphalia, on 3 January 1969,
                to working-class parents Rolf—a bricklayer who later ran the local kart track—and Elisabeth Schumacher
                (1948–2003), who operated the track's canteen.[1] When Schumacher was four, his father modified his
                pedal kart by adding a small motorcycle engine. After Michael crashed it into a lamp post in Kerpen, his
                parents took him to the karting track at Kerpen-Horrem, where he became the youngest member of the
                karting club. His father built him a kart from discarded parts and, at the age of six, Schumacher won
                his first club championship. To support his son's racing, Rolf took on a second job renting and
                repairing karts, while his wife worked at the track's canteen. Nevertheless, when Michael needed a new
                engine costing 800 DM, his parents were unable to afford it; he was able to continue racing with support
                from local businessmen.
            </b>
            <h3>Ferrari</h3>
            <b>
                Schumacher won his third World Drivers' Championship in 2000, and his first with Ferrari, after a
                year-long battle with Häkkinen. Schumacher won the first three races of the season and five of the first
                eight. Midway through the year, Schumacher's chances suffered with three consecutive non-finishes,
                allowing Häkkinen to close the gap in the standings. Häkkinen then took another two victories, before
                Schumacher won at the Italian Grand Prix. At the post-race press conference, after equalling the number
                of wins (41) won by his idol Senna, Schumacher broke into tears.[75] The championship fight would come
                down to the penultimate race of the season, the Japanese Grand Prix. Starting from pole position,
                Schumacher lost the lead to Häkkinen at the start. After his second pit-stop, however, Schumacher came
                out ahead of Häkkinen and went on to win the race and the Drivers' Championship
            </b>
            <h3>Race</h3>
            <b>
                Schumacher is currently the driver with the second-highest number of victories, having won 91 out of 306
                races in his career; the majority of his race victories were for the Ferrari team with 72.
                Michael Schumacher is regarded by a generation of F1 fans to be the greatest of all time with his 91
                race victories, 155 podiums and 68 pole positions only recently bettered by Lewis Hamilton.
                Although Schumacher is remembered for his success, he will forever be associated with controversy with
                the German's never-give-up attitude landing him in hot water on more than one occasion.
